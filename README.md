# PVZ-2024
 pvz-2024
 This repository is redirected from [pvz](https://github.com/liuhanzuo/pvz2024) to make a more OOP-styled approach for the Plant-VS-Zombie game.
## Requirements
Please use Visual Studio (instead of VS code) and the extension [EasyX](https://easyx.cn/setup) for running this project. Follow the instruction in the website to setup easyx, and then open the `.sln` file using Visual Studio command "open project".

If the `main.cpp` can't run at all and give you some compilation errors, please first change the `main` function in `main.cpp` into notes (use `//`), and then change the notes in `test.cpp` into real `main` function. If this time the project can't run as well, then it means that your setup for EasyX isn't complete.
